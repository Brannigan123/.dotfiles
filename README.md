# My Dot Files Repository and Scripts to Sync them

To track new files/directories:

`python track.py {path1} {path2} {path3}...` N/B: all paths are treated relative to the current user's home directory(~)

You can then use git or any other versioning system for version control/syncing the .dotfiles folder content
